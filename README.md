# Factory production optimization
The objective of this project is to select the number of products a factory is going to sell, produce or store during the year. There is also a second part where binary decision variables are added. This project is implemented with python, pyomo and gurobi to solve the problem.

The data used in this project is not real data, this is, the data has been simulated randomly and some changes were applied in order to give some sense to this data.
